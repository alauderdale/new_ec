					About the project
				%p
					Mianzi started as a bamboo bike company focused on clean production of their products. As they evolved, they moved toward production of sustainable bike frames at an affordable price. They required a new face for their company. This project has a special place in my heart, as it required a lot of effort to get the logo just right.

					My role
				%p
					The word mianzi translates to “face” and “bamboo”. I was tasked with designing a mark that communicated the name of the company as it related to their mission.

						One for three.
					%p
						Along with unity, we wanted to communicate the company’s promise to donate one bike to charity for every three sold. This was particularly challenging. Both mianzi and I felt great about where we landed.
